Web programming:
    Three languages
    HTML - hyperText Markup Language: a language that is used to structure
           the content of web pages. All browsers understand HTML.
           A browser is a software that interprets the HTML and
           displays the contents
    HTML consists of tage , most if which  go by pairs, The starting tag has
         a command within angle bracket and the ending one is different by a forward slash
         in front of the command. Between the starting and the ending tag is the content
         to be displayed.
    HTML is case insensitive so you may type a command in any case
         The newest version is HTML5 which requires a declaration before the
         document starts <!doctype html>
    An HTML document is divided into two parts:
         head part: it is within <head>...</head>
                    this part contains the information that is for the
                    search engine spiders/bots.
         body part: it is within the tags <body>...</body>, and contains the
                    information to be displayed

         A starting tag may have the attributes in the syntax
         name = value following the command

         Colors: color names
                 color code #followed by 6 hex decimals

         <STRONG>...</STRONG>
         <B>...</B>
         <I>...</I>
         <CENTER>...</CENTER>
            Headings: <H1>...</H1>
                      ...
                      <H6>...</H6>
         <P>...</P>
         <DIV>...</DIV>
         <SPAN>...</SPAN>
         <BR/> does not go by a pair so it is an empty tag

         Anchor tags: <a href="address"> to be displayed </a>
            1). to link another page
                    the value value of href should be the address of the page
            2). to link an email
                    the value of href should be mailto: followed by an email address

    CSS - cascading style sheet: a language that is used to style a wabpage.
    
    A third language such as javascript, java, php... that makes the webpage dynamic

    The Image tag:
        <img src="pathoftheImage" alt = "What to display if the image is not found"/>

    Lists:
        OrderedList:
            <OL>
                <LI> item number one </LI>
                 <LI> item number two </LI>
                  <LI> item number three </LI>
            </OL>
        UnorderedList:
            <UL>
                <LI> item number one </LI>
                 <LI> item number two </LI>
                  <LI> item number three </LI>
            </UL>\
        DefinitionList:
            <DL>
                <DT>Youmin Lu</DT>
                <DD>A mean professor</DD>
                <DT>Brandon</DT>
                <DD>The youngest student in my class</DD>
                <LI> item number one </LI>
                 <LI> item number two </LI>
                  <LI> item number three </LI>
            </DL>\

    tags can be nested
    
    Tables:
        <table border='value' width='value' height='value'>
            <tr>
                <td>(1,1)</td> <td>(1,2)</td> <td>(1,3)</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>(2,1)</td> <td>(2,2)</td> <td>(2,3)</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        you may marge multiple cells in one row by using the colspac in a td
        tag or in one column by suing rowspan in a td tag

        To interact with viewers we need a form:
            it takes data from the viewers and sends it to the server to e processed.
        A form tag may contain two attributes 
            action  its value is the address of the server which you want to send
                    the data in this form to
            method: its value may be wither Get or POST. The GET value will
                    send the data of this form to the server by appending 
                    it to the url. The POST method will send the data of this form
                    to the server by packaging it in a file
        A form contains control elements that conflict data from the viewers
        and send the data to the server.

        Control elements:
        INPUT:
            attributes: type, name, value, size
                        values for type: 
                            text
                            password
                            checkbox
                            radio
                            submit
                            reset
                          Value of name is the identifier of this INPUT
                          Value of the value attribute is the default value
                          of this input
                          The value of the name attribute is the identifier of
                          this input The submit makes a button that sends the
                          data to the server of the address given to the action attribute
                          The reset makes a button that resets all the controls in
                          this form back to their default values
                          <INPUT type='submit' value='Submit'/>
                          <INPUT type='submit' value='Submit'/>
        SELECT-- a dropdown list
                <SELECT name="Aname" size="number">
                    <OPTION>"1"</OPTION>
                    <OPTION>"2"</OPTION>
                    <OPTION>"3"</OPTION>
                    <OPTION>"4"</OPTION>
                    <OPTION>"5"</OPTION>
                    <OPTION>"6"</OPTION>
                </SELECT>    
        TEXTAREA -- multi line text control

CSS-- the acronym of Cascading Style Sheet that is a language used to style
a web page
    CSS statement syntax: propertyName:value;
     Property Name      values
      font-size          10px 10cm 10in 10em
      color              red color code
      font-family        sans-serif, monspaced

      <P...>

      Three levels of CSS:
      1). in-line CSS: CSS statements are placed as the value of the style
                       attribute of a tag. This one styles the tag content
                       and overrides all other CSS statements
      2). embedded CSS: CSS selectors are placed as the content of the style
                        tag in the head area
                        <style type="text/css">
                            selectors
                        </style>
      3). external CSS: selectors are placed in an external file saved with
                        with .css. The external file may be used by any
                        HTML document with the link tag:
                        <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="filePath.css">

      Three major kinds of selectors
        1). HTML selector:
                htmlTag{
                            css statements
                        }
                The statements will be applied to all tags
                in this page with the tag name
        2). class selectors:
                .className{
                    css statements
                }
                The css statements in a class selector will only be applied
                to the tags whose class attribute takes this class name as
                it's value
        3).  ID selector:
             #idName{
                css statements
             }
             It will style the tag whose it attribute has the Idname as its ID value

    Servlet:
        A Servlet is a class extending the Servlet class in the library.
        It takes data from a form, processes it and sends the results back 
        as a webpage

        A servlet can be activated by a form or a url.
        Methods:
            void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)
            void doPost(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)
            When a Servlet is activated, a HttpServletRequest object and
            HttpServletResponse object are auotmatically supplied to these
            two methods and one of them is automatically called/activated
            according to the value of the attribute in the form tag.

        Methods in HttpServletRequest class:
            String getParameter(String controlName)
            String[] getParameterValues(String controlName)
            RequestDispatcher getRequestDispatcher(String fileName)
            Cookie[] getCookies()-- returns an array that contains the
                                    Cookies in the client machine within         
                                    this session
            HttpSession getSession()--returns an HttpSession object. If there is
                                      no session object, a new one is created.
                                      If there is one, it returns the existing one.

        Methods in HttpServletResponse class:
            PrintWriter getWriter()-returns a PrintWriter object that can
                be used to send a web page back to the viewer
        
        There are two important methods that need to be overridden:
            void doGet()
            void doPost()
            void addCookie(Cookie cookie)

        How to forward or include another page? 
         use the RequestDispatcher class:
            void forward(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)
                          --forward this current page to the page wrapped in
                            this RequestDispatcher
            void include(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)
                          --insert the page wrapped in this RequestDispatcher
                            object into the current page

Session Tracking:
 HTTP is stateless: whne you move from one page to another page, the data
 from the first page is lost. If you minimize a page and go to another page,
 the data is lost when you get back

 1) Session tracking using Cookies
     A cookie is a small text file in the client's machine
    Cookie class:
        constructor: Cookie(String name, String value)
        methods: String getName()
                 String getValue()
 2) Session tracking using Java Session
    HttpSession class:
        method:
            void setAttribute(String name, Object object)--binds this name with
                 the object.
            Object getAttribute(String name)
